# Advanced CCTV Analytics Solution using Python YOLO

Welcome to our Advanced CCTV Analytics Solution repository! This project is a technological solution based on live CCTV feeds using machine learning. It can automatically detect incidents related to street crime, violence, burglary, etc., and generate alerts to the nearest Police Station. We leveraged the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework for the development of this project.

## Key Features

- **Incident Detection**: Automatically identifies incidents related to street crime, violence, burglary, etc.
- **Alert Generation**: Generates alerts to the nearest Police Station in real-time.
- **YOLO Integration**: Utilizes the YOLO object detection framework for accurate and efficient detection.

## Project Purpose

This project was developed for the purpose of Kavach 2022, and we are proud to announce that we ranked first in the Internal Hackathon. The solution addresses critical issues related to public safety and law enforcement.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the backend logic.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Object detection framework for real-time detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms for incident detection based on live CCTV feeds.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chirag30Sharma/cctv-analytics.git
2. Set up the required dependencies.
3. Run the application.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have live CCTV feeds accessible to the system.
2. Start the application to initiate real-time incident detection.
3. Alerts will be generated and sent to the nearest Police Station automatically.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the organizers of Kavach 2023 for providing us with the opportunity to develop and showcase this innovative solution.
